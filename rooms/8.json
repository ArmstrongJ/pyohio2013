{ "name" : "Great Hall Meeting Room",
  "description" : "This large meeting room appears to be in the middle of preparations for some sort of function.  There are a number of round tables set up, but there are no chairs around them.  The lights in the room are off, and the only light is streaming in from the doors to the south.  This room certainly isn't being used for the PyOhio conference.",
