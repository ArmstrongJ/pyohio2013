{ "name" : "Stained Glass Lounge",
  "description" : "This lounge features a tall, two-story window looking out onto the Ohio State campus to the west.  This early in the morning the tables, chairs, and couches are empty.  Staircases lead up to the third floor and down to the ground floor.  The southern balcony is currently closed off by a janitor's cart, and you can see a uniformed man vacuuming the bright red carpet.  A hallway leads off to the north.",
